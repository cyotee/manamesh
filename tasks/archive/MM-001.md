## Dependencies

## User Stories

### US-MM-001.1: Local Hotseat Play

As a player, I want to play a card game locally with another person on the same device so that I can test game mechanics.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Lobby UI with "Local Hotseat" button
- [x] Two-player game with alternating turns
- [x] Draw, play, and discard card actions
- [x] Win condition (first to play 5 cards)

### US-MM-001.2: Game State Management

As a developer, I want game logic separated from UI so that it can be tested independently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Pure game logic functions in `logic.ts`
- [x] boardgame.io wrapper in `game.ts`
- [x] Unit tests for core moves

## Technical Details

- React + Vite for frontend tooling
