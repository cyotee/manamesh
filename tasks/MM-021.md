## Description

Implement the War card game module - the simplest possible game to validate the core module system. Two players flip cards, higher card wins both.

## Dependencies

- MM-019: Core Game Module Interface
- MM-020: Deck Plugin for boardgame.io
- MM-018: Standard Playing Cards Asset Pack

## User Stories

### US-MM-021.1: War Game Play

As a player, I want to play War so that I can test the game module system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Module exports boardgame.io Game object
- [x] Setup deals 26 cards to each player
- [x] flipCard move: player reveals top card
- [x] resolveRound move: compare cards, winner takes both
- [x] War scenario: matching cards trigger war (3 face-down, 1 face-up)
- [x] Game ends when one player has all 52 cards
- [x] Uses zone-based state compatible with DeckPlugin
- [x] Zones: deck (hidden), played (public), won (public)
- [x] Works with Standard Playing Cards asset pack (standard_52 idFormat)
- [x] Tests cover full game flow (56 tests)

## Technical Details

### Game State

```typescript
interface WarState {
  players: {
    [playerId: string]: {
      deck: WarCard[];      // Face-down deck
      played: WarCard[];    // Currently played card(s)
      won: WarCard[];       // Won cards pile
    };
  };
  warInProgress: boolean;
  winner: string | null;
}
```

### Moves

- `flipCard`: Reveal top card from deck to played zone
- `resolveRound`: Compare played cards, award to winner

### Zones

| Zone | Visibility | Ordered | Shared |
|------|------------|---------|--------|
| deck | hidden | yes | no |
| played | public | no | no |
| won | public | no | no |
